            <h2>Gameboy Project</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                Programmed games (Snake, Skyfall) in Arduino IDE with Raspberry Pi Pico, buttons, and ST7789 240x320 TFT Display. 
                Currently in the process of designing a 3D printed case for the device, will be soldering components onto a perfboard
                with a Battery Management System IC, Class-D Amplifier, and Speaker to make the device more portable and enjoyable.
                Will also add MicroSD IC to allow for more complex games.

            <p class="project-description">
                Designed a 32-bit pipelined RISC-V CPU in Logisim with ALU, register file, immediate generator, and control logic, 
                with a 2-stage IF/EX pipeline supporting arithmetic, branches, loads/stores, and jumps, plus branch/jump flushing 
                for control hazards.

            <h2>🎸 Analog Guitar Treble Booster</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                Designed and built a treble booster circuit to enhance guitar tone by amplifying high-frequency harmonics.
                Utilized op-amp-based active filters to achieve a gain of ~10× in the 3 kHz–15 kHz range. Tuned component
                values to emphasize clarity and bite in solos while reducing low-frequency muddiness.
